#Unified Analytics for Government
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurenancona/unified-analytics/master/images/container-vis.jpg)

This will be an ongoing documentation of one method for implementing web analytics to track many government agency websites within a single Google Analytics profile, with the goal of populating a dashboarding tool such as [analytics-reporter](https://github.com/18F/analytics-reporter) or [city-analytics-dashboard](https://github.com/codeforamerica/city-analytics-dashboard).

**_This guide is under active development_**

##About this Guide
I've included 2 ways to get up and running: **[The Easy Way](EasyWay.md)**, and the [**_"I want to understand how to do this"_**](https://github.com/laurenancona/unified-analytics#google-analytics) way. In the near future, I'm planning to build a wizard-style version of **[The Easy Way](EasyWay.md)** (stay tuned).
